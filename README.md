# What can work but I'm not sure:
- FaceTime and iMessage - I followed the guide, but I still can't log in. Maybe I will have to contact Apple Support;
- AirDrop (I'll check this when my iPhone will arrive and update).

# Bugs:
- Hibernation;
- Boot animation.

# Audio:
I'm using voodoo kext. You can also patch AppleHDA. If You use voodoohda, You have to swap between jack and built in speakers manually.

# Other:
If you have fixed something, fork this repository and pull request. I will update the repository after checking the changes.

If you have found any error, fell free to open issue.
